            <h1>Broadband Access Technology and Modem</h1>
            <h2>Broadband Wireless 1024-QAM Modem</h2>
            <p>The broadband wireless 1024-QAM modem is equipped with a powerful LDPC codec and advanced Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE) which is combined with a Carrier Tracking Circuit. The modem supports 4-QAM, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, 256-QAM and 1024-QAM modulation-rates, combined with LDPC code rates of 0.5 and 0.75, selected according to channel conditions. The modem also supports large dynamic range (100dB) Automatic-Gain-Control (AGC), power control, and Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM).</p>
            <p>The modem is designed to perform high speed data communication with reliable quality in any harsh communication channel environment and to support the usage of any carrier frequency from the cellular band carrier frequency up to the millimeter-wave band carrier frequency (80 GHz). The modem is a Gigabit-class modem and is robust not only to additive white Gaussian noise but also to phase noise.</p>
            <p>Performance testing of the modem shows the modem to be within 1~2 dB or 3~4dB away from the theoretical BER curve, dependent upon the modulation technology and channel condition used.</p>
            <p>(Please refer to the attached white paper for a more thorough system description and performance simulation results of the modem).</p>

            <h1>Core Component Technology</h1>
            <p>Technology used in wideband communication systems require high coding/modulation gain, very short latency, and real time processing as much as possible. GScom has developed these core component technologies for application in Gigabit-class wireless communication systems.</p>
            <p>Following are some of the typical core component technologies developed by GScom.</p>
            <p>(Please refer to the attached white papers for further information on the corresponding core component technology and performance simulation results).</p>
            <ul>
              <li><h3>LDPC (Low Density Parity Check) codec</h3></li>
                <p>LDPC is the one of the most powerful linear block codes in terms of performance (coding gain). LDPC decoding algorithm is inherently parallel which is attractive for high-speed applications.</p>
                <p>GScom has developed a custom LDPC codec (encoder/decoder) using the following LDPC architecture and technologies:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Architecture aware LDPC for low complexity and fast encoding.</li>
                    <li>Horizontal and vertical partitioning LDPC for low complexity and fast decoding.</li>
                    <li>Optimal node degree distribution LDPC for best performance with optimum complexity.</li>
                    <li>Architecture aware parallel TDMP for low complexity and fast decoding.</li>
                    <li>Mother code rates of 0.5 and 0.75.</li>
                    <li>Achievement of 8~10 dB coding gain with a code length of 8640 and a code rate of 0.5 in the reasonable SNR ranges for data communication.</li>
                  </ul>
                <h4><a href="whitepaper4.html" target="_blank">White Paper: LDPC Algorithm &amp; System Design</a></h4>
              <li><h3>Mapper / De-mapper (Slicer)</h3></li>
                  <p>The Mapper takes the coded bit stream at the output of the (LDPC) encoder and maps each group of m bits into one of the M) = 2^m) signal constellations. The De-mapper receives the demodulated symbols from the demodulator and converts the received symbols into the soft decision values of the corresponding bit stream through a soft decision decoding process.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>256-QAM Mapper / De-mapper (Slicer)</li>
                      <p>GScom has developed a real-time 256-QAM mapper / de-mapper.</p>
                    <li>1024-QAM De-mapper (Slicer)</li>
                      <p>GScom has developed a real-time 1024-QAM mapper / de-mapper.</p>
                  </ul>

              <li><h3>Equalizer combined with carrier recovery</h3></li>
                <p>Fading, inter-symbol interference, time varying channel characteristics, large dynamic range of signal to noise ratio (SNR), etc, are major signal impairment factors in the broadband wireless communication systems. Phase noise is also one of the most critical signal impairment factors in wireless communication systems which use high carrier frequencies with high-order M-QAM such as 256-QAM or 1024-QAM modulation technologies.</p>
                <p>GScom has developed an advanced fractionally spaced Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE) which is combined with a carrier recovery circuit. The carrier recovery combined with the DFE is a powerful solution to fight against phase noise through the latency reduction between phase noise estimation and correction.</p>

            <li><h3>Time Tracking (symbol tracking and frame tracking)</h3></li>
              <p>GScom has developed the symbol synchronization and frame synchronization technologies using a preamble sequence in the acquisition frame, and symbol tracking and frame time tracking using a time Delay Locked Loop (DLL) with the 2^nd order Phase Locked Loop (PLL).</p>

            <li><h3>AGC (Automatic Gain Control)</h3></li>
              <p>The signal in a wireless communication channel experiences a large dynamic range of signal variations due to channel conditions, weather conditions, flat fading, and shading effect of the communication environment.</p>
              <p>GScom has developed several types of AGC in terms of accuracy, HW simplicity, and reliability based on the following common AGC specification:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Input signal dynamic range of 100 dB</li>
                <li>Flat fading rate of 100 dB / sec</li>
                <li>Output signal level of 20 dBm +/- 3dB.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4><a href="whitepaper1.html">White Paper: Automatic Gain Control Systems Document</a></h4>

            <li><h3>ACM (Adaptive Coding and Modulation)</h3></li>
              <p>ACM is a communication technology which is used to maximize the communication system efficiency with a given channel condition.</p>
              <p>GScom has developed the ACM technology using real-time channel information of the SNR from the equalizer, RSSI from the AGC, and desired range of SNR in the modulation and coding technology. The ACM supports 4-QAM, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, 256-QAM and 1024-QAM modulation rates and LDPC code rates of 0.5 and 0.75.</p>
